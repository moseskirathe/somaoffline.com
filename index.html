	Who are we?
	</button>
	<div class="panel"><p>
		Soma is an educational company that provides access to high quality,
		world-class educational material without the need of an internet

	What is the Soma Academic Platform
	</button>
	<div class="panel"><p>
		The Soma Academic Platform is an <strong>offline</strong>web application that
		contains content that has been created by Soma, as well as content that has been
		carefully curated from various online educational websites.
		To ensure that the content is relevant and specific to our users, we have different
		versions of the platform for different user groups, depending on age and education
		level. For example, a learner between the ages of 7-14 will gain access to
	    educational tools and resources that will help them prepare for their KCPE examinations,
		while a high school student will access content that helps them prepare for their KCSE
		examinations. All versions of the Soma Academic Platform contain content that is
		non-specific to age or educational level. This includes content that equips the
		learner with personal finance management skills, computing and information technology
		skills, robotics, medicine, engineering concepts e.t.c

		What is a Soma Server?
		</button>
		<div class="panel"><p>
			A soma server is a small electronic device hosts the Soma Academic Platform, 
			allowing you to access the content without the need of an internet connection.</p></div>
		<button class="accordion">
			How does the Soma Server work?
			</button>
			<div class="panel"><p>

				<ul>
					<li>African Book Hub</li>
					<li>Fincom Technologies Limited</li>
				</ul>
				We will regularly update this list as we expand our distribution partners network.

			    and we will deliver a soma server to your doorstep.

					Can my device access the academic platform?
					</button>
					<div class="panel"><p>
						All wifi enabled devices are able to access the Soma Academic Platform.
					</p></div>
					<button class="accordion">
						How do I update content on my server?
						</button>
						<div class="panel"><p>
							Having relevant content for the modern world is our priority, and it forms the core
							of our mission. Our top most goal is to provide content that is not only useful to know,
							but is relevant now and in the future. To this end, we work extremely hard to ensure our
							the content on the server is regularly updated to match the educational needs of our
							evolving world. We update the Soma Academic Platform every six months, adding onto 
							it valuable and relevant content while getting rid of the outdated content, content
							that is no longer useful. To access the latest version of the server, please visit 
							your nearest distribution partner, or visit to our <a href="#">online portal</a> to
							download the updates directly to your server.</p></div>
							<button class="accordion">
								Can I access content from other publishers and content creators?
								</button>
								<div class="panel"><p>
									Yes. While our goal has been to build a platform that meets all your 
									child’s educational needs, we realize that every child is different and may 
									thus need / want access to resources that are not yet available on the platform.
									These resources may be from other creators or publishers. The good news is,
									you can now access content from other creators / publishers. To access content
									from other creators or publishers, simply buy the content in form of a Soma SD card
									from one of our distributing partners, and insert it to the server. Then, following
									the steps highlighted in the instructional video above, connect to the server to access
									the content</p></div>						
									<button class="accordion">
						I do not have electricity at school / home. Can I still use the Soma Server?
						</button>
						<div class="panel"><p>
							Yes, you certainly can! At the moment, you can use alternative sources of 
							power such as a power bank. We are now developing a solar power enabled server,
							for we believe this will significantly increase access to the Soma Academic Platform. 
							Please sign up to our mailing list at the bottom of the page and we will update you 
							once we launch Solar Powered Soma Server!</p></div>
						<button class="accordion">
							Does the Soma Server have a warranty?
							</button>
							<div class="panel"><p>
							Yes. When you purchase a new Soma Server from one of our distribution partners, 
							you will receive a 12 month warranty on the server. The same applies to all 
							servers purchased directly from us.</p></div>
							<button class="accordion">
								Who is a Soma Distribution partner?	</button>
								<div class="panel"><p>
									As we expand and grow, we strive to ensure that wherever you are able to buy
									a content server wherever you are. To this end, we have partnered with
									distribution partners. Our distribution partners are ideally bookshops 
									and electronic shops that stock the Soma Servers, so that you are able 
									to easily purchase a Soma Server / Soma Content with ease. Below is a 
									list of all current Soma Distribution Partners:<br>
